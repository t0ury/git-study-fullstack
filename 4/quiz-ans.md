## 2. If you accidentally add a file to the staging area, you can remove it using git reset. For example, if you accidentally add thrid.md, but donâ€™t want it to be committed yet, run git reset thrid.md and the file will be removed from the staging area, but it will still be in your working directory.

`True`

## 3. The commands git reset and git revert can only be used to undo commits in the git repository.

`True`

## 4. The commands git checkout can be used to roll back to a certain commit hash (check the documentation if you are unsure).

`False`
git checkout use to switch branches or restore working tree files.

## 5. We cannot commit changes in the working directory directly to the repo without adding it to the staging index first (read the documentation if you are unsure)

`True`

## 6. git log -p and git log will give you the same output

`False`

## 7. git log --oneline and git log --stat will give you the same output

`False`

## 8. It is recommended that in most cases we should use git revert rather than git reset to undo commits because git revert is safer.

`False`
Both can be considered safe, if not using the --force flag. However, git revert create a new commit log which record the revert action, while git reset will remove the commit history.
